The initial private residence of billionaire philanthropist — and everyone’s favorite superhero — Tony Stark, is a massive, futuristic mansion set on a sea-side cliff along the coast of Malibu.
The high tech house comes with an integrated artificial intelligence system initially created to help out around the house (among other, more famous purposes) that Tony Stark named “Just a Rather Very Intelligent System”, shortened J.A.R.V.I.S., after his childhood butler Edwin Jarvis.
And while the choice in tech setup is all Tony, in terms of decor, the Stark mansion bears the signature of on-screen love interest Pepper Potts.
